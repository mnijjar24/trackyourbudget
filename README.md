## Welcome to the Budget Tracker Application

The budget tracker application was created so that travellers can be able to track their withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection in order to maintain an accurate account balance while travelling. If the traveller does not have internet connection where they currently are in the world, when the expense or deposit is inputed, the trabelled will recieve a notification that they have added an expense or deposit. Also, when the user reestablishes an internet connection, then the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated. This is extremely convienent for travellers as it is not certain where there will be internet connection or not, and regardless of this, the budget tracker application is extremely reliable and the account balance will remain accurate anywhere in the world!
